# Project Title: Heart Disease Diagnosis using Machine Learning
Project Description
This project implements machine learning models to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient clinical data. The system analyzes various health metrics including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other cardiac indicators to assess heart disease risk.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, duplicates, and performs one-hot encoding for categorical variables

Multiple ML Models: Implements and compares:

Naive Bayes Classifier (Accuracy: ~80%)

K-Nearest Neighbors (Accuracy: ~73%)

Support Vector Machine (Accuracy: ~71%)

Logistic Regression (Accuracy: ~85%)

Feature Engineering: Includes relevant clinical features and proper encoding of categorical variables

Technical Details:
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy

Dataset: Heart disease dataset with 918 patient records and 12 clinical features

How to Use:
Clone the repository

Install required dependencies (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy)

Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and model training

The trained models can be saved and deployed for predictions

Results:
The logistic regression model performed best with 85% accuracy, making it suitable for preliminary heart disease risk assessment.

This would make an excellent addition to your GitHub profile, demonstrating your skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model implementation for healthcare applications.
